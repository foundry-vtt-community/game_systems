# Fate	

Foundry systems based on the Fate Core and Accelerated systems by Evil Hat Productions, available under Creative Commons.

[Index Card RPG](https://www.icrpg.com/) (ICRPG) by [Runehammer Games](https://www.runehammer.online/) takes classic tabletop mechanics for telling stories, making monsters and rolling dice, but throws out all the clunky parts that keep most folks from trying an adventure or two.
