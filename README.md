# Dungeons & Dragons

## [D&D5e](Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons/dnd5e.md)
An implementation of the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset under the OGL. This system currently comes bundled with Foundry VTT, but in the future may be distributed separately. Please feel free to post issues or pull requests to the GitLab repo for my consideration.

# Pathfinder

Foundry systems for the various Pathfinder editions.

## [Pathfinder 2e](Pathfinder/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e.md)
This system adds support for Pathfinder Second Edition to Foundry VTT.

# Warhammer Fantasy

Foundry systems for the various Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay editions.

## [WFRP 4E System](Warhammer%20Fantasy/WFRP-4th-Edition-FoundryVTT.md)
Installing this system allows you to create campaigns in the grim and perilous world of Warhammer Fantasy 4th edition!

# 13th Age

Foundry systems for the 13th Age RPG.

## [13th Age System (Archmage)](13th%20Age/archmage.md)
This system adds support for the 13th Age RPG in your Foundry VTT campaigns! To get the most out of it, you can also install the [Dice Calculator](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/foundry-vtt-dice-calculator) module to add the ability to include inline dice rolls in power cards.

# FATE

Foundry systems based on the FATE Core and Accelerated systems by Evil Hat Productions.

## [FATE Core & Accelerated](FATE/fate.md)
This system adds support for FATE Core and FATE Accelerated (FAE) to Foundry VTT. Currently in Alpha stage, only FAE character sheets and Stunts are available.

# Starfinder

## [starfinder](Starfinder/foundryvtt-starfinder.md)
This system brings support for the Starfinder RPG to Foundry VTT. The system provides sheets for player characters, NPC's, starships, and vehicles. There isn't any compendium content provided currently. That should come in a future update.

# Other

## [Simple Worldbuilding System](Other/worldbuilding.md)
A simple game system for Foundry VTT which allows for flexible definition of Actors and Items to assist with worldbuilding or for running games which do not have a more complete system implementation available.
