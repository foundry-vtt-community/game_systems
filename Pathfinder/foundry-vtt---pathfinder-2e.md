### Description
This system adds support for Pathfinder Second Edition to Foundry VTT.

Please Note:
- Functionality is not complete with plenty of work remaining.
- This is a fork of the dnd5e system so there may still be references to dnd5e in places and the assets from 5e are included for now (I plan to use them soon).
- If you find any issues or have any feedback please let me know.

Known Issues:
- AC is not automatically calculated, Just enter it in the input field.
- Critical damage is not calculated currently.

To install the system, follow these instructions:
1. Download the zip file included in the system directory.
1. Extract the included folder to public/systems in your Foundry Virtual Tabletop installation folder.
1. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop.
