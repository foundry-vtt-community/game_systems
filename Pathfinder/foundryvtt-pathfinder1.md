### Description	
A system for the first edition of Pathfinder in FoundryVTT.	
Documentation can be viewed [here](https://furyspark.gitlab.io/foundryvtt-pathfinder1-doc/)	

Supports various automatic calculations, buffs and debuffs, low-light vision, and more.	

Mostly feature complete, but might be buggy here and there.	

Be aware that this is a fork of the dnd5e system, so there are a bunch of similarities internally.
