### Description	
**This package is outdated and while still functional for a time will no longer be updated further. Users should migrate to one of the two other actively-developed systems**
This system adds support for Fate Core and Fate Accelerated (FAE) to Foundry VTT. Currently still in development, and only the FAE character sheet is functional.
