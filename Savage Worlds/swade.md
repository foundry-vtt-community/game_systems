### Description	

This system adds support for Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.	
Currently There are only Wildcard sheets available but Extra sheets will be added, as will Vehicles.	
All basic Items types (skills, edges, weapons, etc) are supported, with sheets, although there is a visual overhaul for them planned.	
There are currently no compendiums as there are still some open legal questions. Initative, automation and full translation support are planned.	

Still WiP. Message me with any bug reports or feature requests	

Please refer to the README for installation instructions
