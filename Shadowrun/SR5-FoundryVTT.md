### Description	
This system adds support for Shadowrun 5th Edition. 	
There are sheets for Players -- grunts, vehicles, and spirits are planned.	
Spells, Weapons, Matrix Devices, and many other items are supported. Many values are auto-calculated from equipped items (armor, essence, matrix attributes).	
Currently no compendium items, waiting for a more stable position before beginning that.	

Still work in progress. Message me with feature requests/bug reports.
